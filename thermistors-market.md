<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTC</li><li>NTC</li><li>CTR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermistor market consists of three main types: Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) thermistors, Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors, and Current Temperature Resistance (CTR) thermistors. PTC thermistors increase resistance with rising temperature, often used for over-current protection. NTC thermistors, with decreasing resistance as temperature rises, are widely employed in temperature sensing and control. CTR thermistors combine features of both PTC and NTC, adapting their resistance based on both temperature and current, facilitating advanced electronic applications.</p></p>
