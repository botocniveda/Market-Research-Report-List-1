<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Laser Telemeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Method Telemeter</li><li>Pulse Method Telemeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld laser telemeter market comprises primarily two types: phase method telemeters and pulse method telemeters. Phase method telemeters measure distance by comparing the phase shift of a laser beam reflected from a target, providing high accuracy for short to medium ranges. In contrast, pulse method telemeters utilize short laser pulses, measuring the time it takes for the pulse to return after reflecting off a target, making them suitable for longer distances. Both types are widely used in construction, surveying, and engineering applications.</p></p>
