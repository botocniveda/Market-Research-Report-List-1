<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stearic Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fractionation</li><li>Pressing Method</li><li>Hydrogenation Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stearic acid market can be categorized into three main types: fractionation, pressing, and hydrogenation methods. </p><p>Fractionation involves separating fatty acids from fats or oils through cooling and crystallization, yielding high-purity stearic acid. The pressing method utilizes mechanical means to extract stearic acid from oilseeds, maintaining the acid's natural properties. Hydrogenation, on the other hand, converts unsaturated fats into saturated ones through hydrogen gas, enhancing stability and shelf-life. Each method offers unique benefits suited for various applications in industries like cosmetics, food, and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
