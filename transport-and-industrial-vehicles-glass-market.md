<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transport and Industrial Vehicles Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated</li><li>Tempered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transport and Industrial Vehicles Glass Market encompasses two primary types: laminated and tempered glass. Laminated glass consists of layers of glass bonded with a plastic interlayer, enhancing safety and security by preventing shattering. It is commonly used in windshields and heavy-duty vehicles. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is heat-treated for increased strength and safety, shattering into small, blunt pieces upon breakage. This type is often utilized in side and rear windows, offering durability and impact resistance.</p></p>
