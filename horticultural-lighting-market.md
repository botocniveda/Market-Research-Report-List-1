<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horticultural Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toplighting</li><li>Interlighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horticultural lighting market consists of two primary types: toplighting and interlighting. Toplighting involves placing lights above the crop canopy, providing uniform illumination and promoting healthy growth across the entire plant. This method is particularly effective for large-scale operations. Interlighting, on the other hand, involves positioning lights within the plant canopy, allowing for targeted illumination of lower leaves and enhancing light penetration. This approach is beneficial for maximizing photosynthesis and improving yields in densely planted environments. Both methods cater to diverse cultivation needs.</p></p>
