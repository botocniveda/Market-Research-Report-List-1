<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The β-blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonselective Agents</li><li>Selective Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The β-blocker market is categorized into nonselective and selective agents. Nonselective β-blockers, such as propranolol, affect both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors, making them effective for various conditions like hypertension and anxiety but may cause respiratory side effects. Selective agents, like metoprolol and atenolol, primarily target β1 receptors, offering cardiovascular benefits with fewer respiratory risks, making them preferable for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both types play crucial roles in treating cardiovascular disorders.</p></p>
