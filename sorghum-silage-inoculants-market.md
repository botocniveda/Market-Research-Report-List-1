<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sorghum Silage Inoculants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heterofermentative</li><li>Homofermentative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sorghum silage inoculants are categorized into two main types: heterofermentative and homofermentative. Heterofermentative inoculants promote the fermentation of sugars into various byproducts, including lactic acid, ethanol, and acetic acid, enhancing overall nutrient preservation and improving aerobic stability. In contrast, homofermentative inoculants predominantly convert sugars into lactic acid, which effectively acidifies the silage and supports better fermentation. Both types aim to improve the quality and digestibility of sorghum silage, catering to different nutritional and preservation needs.</p></p>
